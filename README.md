MEAN STACK BELT TEST

This was the final test for MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) stack at Coding Dojo Boot Camp.
This test has full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions) application.
The test was about creating a Pet Shelter listing website where people can adopt the pet of their liking.

Only able to  upload the files since git can't accept more than 100 files. Node_module couldn't be uploaded to fully view the completed project. The important part are the components and the server.js
